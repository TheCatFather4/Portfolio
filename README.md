## About
This is the code to my [portfolio website](https://www.jmarcello.dev/)

The website was made with ASP.NET Core and features a full-stack web application; 4th Wall Cafe.
There is also an API called Cafe API that can be used by clients for ordering items from the 4th Wall Cafe. 
Check out the swagger documentation for [Cafe API](https://www.jmarcello.dev/swagger/)

### Coming Soon to the 4th Wall Cafe

Currently users can register an account, login, logout, manage their profile, and add/remove items to/from their shopping cart.
