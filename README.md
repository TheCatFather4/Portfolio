## Featured Projects

# [The 4th Wall Cafe](https://www.jmarcello.dev/Home/Cafe)
This is a _full-stack_ web application that utilizes **ASP.NET Core (MVC)** for the _front-end_ portion.<br>
The _back-end_ is written in **C#** and utilizes both **Entity Framework Core** and **Dapper** (Micro-ORM) for data persistence.<br>
**ASP.NET Core Identity** is also used for authentication and authorization.<br>
Additionally, the **Bootstrap** framework is used to make the website _responsive_.<br>

## Application Features

### Two Database Modes
There are two _different_ database modes that can be set up for effective data persistence.<br>
**1.) Entity Framework Core:** A framework ideal for _light weight queries_.<br>
**2.) Dapper:** A micro-ORM ideal for _greater granular control_.<br>

>[!NOTE]
>In order to switch between database modes, simply change the value for the "DatabaseMode" key found in the **appsettings.json** file.<br>
>The default value; "ORM" is set up to use Entity Framework Core. If you would like to use Dapper, change the value to "Dapper".
