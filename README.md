## Featured Projects

### [4th Wall Cafe](https://www.jmarcello.dev/Cafe/)
A full-stack web application made with ASP.NET Core (MVC) and ASP.NET Identity.

I began building this application from an empty ASP.NET Core project, and an empty Microsoft SQL Server image.<br>
And now, it features the ability to register users as a customer, login, place orders, simulate payments, and much more.<br>

>[!NOTE]
>On the [login](https://www.jmarcello.dev/Account/Login) page there are two sample accounts that will allow you to access the management and accountant roles.

### Database Implementations
There are two different database modes that can be implemented in the data persistence layer.<br> 
 - Entity Framework Core (for light weight queries)
 - Dapper (for more granular control)

>[!TIP]
>Simply change the database mode in the appsettings.json file from "ORM" to "Dapper" if you would like to switch between frameworks.
